    <h1>Registration Form and Portfolio Project</h1>
    <p>This project starts with a simple registration form built using HTML. Once the form is filled out and submitted, it automatically redirects to my portfolio website.</p>
    <p>I took care of creating the form and the portfolio using HTML, while ChatGPT helped me out with additional tasks and improvements along the way. It’s been a fun and educational experience, and I’ve learned a lot about HTML in the process!</p>
